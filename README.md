# Fixing-The-Ortega-Observatory
This repository includes the code to control right ascension and declanation for the Ortega Observatory. Furthermore, it includes useful information from working with the CAN Bus protocol, specfically through Electrocraft's drivers and motors. 
Keep in mind this code was meant as a proof concept, meaning it works, but it is not the cleanest.
